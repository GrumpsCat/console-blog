Hi, it’s Greg.  

This site is completely personal—a place where I keep the things I enjoy exploring and writing about.  

I like to write about:  

- **Food** – Every meal is its own story, whether it’s something I’ve cooked or discovered.  
- **Travel** – Notes, impressions, and details from places I’ve been.  
- **Films** – What I’ve watched, what stayed with me, and why.  
- **Books** – Reading that sparks ideas or just keeps me curious.  
- **Technology** – Tools, experiments, and things I build or tinker with.  

It’s all collected here, in one simple space that I can keep adding to over time.  

I built this site with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) using the [Console theme](https://github.com/mrmierzejewski/hugo-theme-console), because I like its clean, console-inspired design—it keeps things direct and uncluttered.
