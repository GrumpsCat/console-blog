I decided the night before that I was going to Dallas. There wasn’t much planning involved, just a sudden craving for barbecue and the idea of going somewhere I had never been. It felt impulsive and exciting in the way last-minute trips do. By morning I was on my way, imagining plates of brisket and smoky air lingering over long picnic tables.

When I arrived, the first thing that hit me was the heat. It was 110 degrees and felt like opening an oven door you could not close. The air shimmered on the pavement and wrapped itself around you until it felt impossible to escape it. I boarded the DART light rail, the train that would carry me into the city. It turns out it is the longest light rail system in the country, and riding it gave me time to watch Dallas appear on the horizon. Flat suburbs slowly gave way to clusters of glass and steel. Each station brought me closer until the skyline filled the windows: mirrored towers, sharp edges, and reflections of clouds gliding over their surfaces.  

I stayed near Dealey Plaza, a place I had only read about before. Standing there felt strange, like stepping into a photograph you have seen too many times. The plaza itself is smaller than you expect, bordered by brick buildings that rise over the streets, while the hum of traffic mixes with the murmur of tourists pointing toward history they have only known in stories.

But before all that, there was barbecue.  

The first stop was Peach Lodge. I ordered brisket, mac and cheese, and pulled pork, and it was everything I wanted it to be. The brisket came in thick slices, each one tender enough to pull apart with a fork, smoky edges giving way to meat that nearly melted. The mac and cheese was creamy and rich, the kind that sticks to the spoon and feels like comfort in every bite. The pulled pork was tangy and perfectly seasoned, piled high on the tray. Sitting there with a plate of food in front of me and the smell of oak smoke hanging in the air, I thought, this was worth the trip all on its own.  

That evening I explored Deep Ellum. The neighborhood buzzed with color and noise, walls covered in bright murals, music drifting out of bars, and the occasional whir of skateboards over the pavement. I wandered past neon signs and crowded patios before ducking into thrift stores filled with racks of vintage denim and shelves of odd treasures. It felt like a place that never really quiets down, even when the sun finally dips low.

The next day, I made my way to Terry Black’s. I had heard about it long before I came to Dallas, and walking through the door felt like joining a line of people who knew exactly what they were here for. My first meal was sausage, Mexican rice, creamed corn, and cornbread. The sausage snapped perfectly when you bit into it, smoky and juicy all at once. The creamed corn was silky and rich, the kind you keep eating even after you’re full, and the cornbread was warm and sweet with a soft crumb.  

I went back the next day. I could not help myself. This time it was brisket again, paired with potato salad, pinto beans, and banana pudding. The brisket was even better than the first time, maybe because I already knew how good it would be. The banana pudding was cool and sweet, with soft vanilla wafers hiding at the bottom, a perfect finish after the heat of the day.

In between all the meals, I found time to slow down. I stopped at Mirror Café for a Colombian pourover, watching the barista pour water in slow circles over the grounds until the coffee bloomed. I sat by the window with the cup in my hands, the air conditioning almost too cold after stepping in from the sun. Later, I visited the Dallas Museum of Art, wandering its quiet halls and cooling off while staring at paintings that felt a world away from the heat outside. The next stop was the Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza. It was impossible not to feel the weight of history there, looking out over Elm Street from the same window you’ve seen in black-and-white photographs.

The trip was short, but it felt full. Between bites of brisket, thrift store shelves, tall buildings glinting in the sun, and the hum of trains carrying me across the city, I felt like I had stepped out of routine in the best way. Dallas was hot and loud, but it had a rhythm that pulled me in. I left with clothes I didn’t need, a head full of music and murals from Deep Ellum, and the memory of meals that I’ll probably talk about for months.

Most of all, I left with a reminder of how good it feels to go somewhere new, even if only for a couple of days. A trip doesn’t have to be long or perfectly planned to matter. Sometimes all it takes is a decision made the night before, a train ride into a city you’ve never seen, and a few plates of barbecue worth crossing state lines for.
